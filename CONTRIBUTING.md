## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Ready to write some code? Hereâ€™s how to get your development environment set up.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup Steps

1.  **Fork and Clone the Repository**
    -   First, [fork](https://github.com/LMLK-seal/NodeOpti/fork) the repository to your own GitHub account.
    -   Then, clone your fork to your local machine:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/NodeOpti.git
        cd NodeOpti
        ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    -   Install all the required packages for development.
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

3.  **Link for Local Testing (Crucial Step!)**
    -   To test your local changes using the `nodeopti` command in your terminal, you need to create a symbolic link.
        ```bash
        npm link
        ```
    -   This command tells your system that whenever you type `nodeopti`, it should run the code from *this project folder*, not the globally installed version from NPM.

4.  **Run the Tests**
    -   Before making any changes, ensure all existing tests are passing.
        ```bash
        npm test
        ```

You are now ready to start developing!

## Submitting a Pull Request

1.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix from the `main` branch. Please use a descriptive name.
    ```bash
    # For a new feature
    git checkout -b feature/new-amazing-codemod

    # For a bug fix
    git checkout -b fix/tree-visualizer-bug
    ```
2.  Make your code changes.
3.  Add new tests for your changes if applicable.
4.  Ensure all tests still pass with `npm test`.
5.  Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive commit message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add new codemod for date-fns library"
    ```
6.  Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/new-amazing-codemod
    ```
7.  Go to the original NodeOpti repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request. Please provide a clear description of your changes.

## Coding Style

-   Please try to match the existing coding style and formatting in the project.
-   We use `const` where possible and prefer modern JavaScript features where appropriate.
-   Comment your code where the logic is complex or non-obvious.

Thank you again for your contribution!
